** Contributing with Content

*** Markdown

The Markdown content is located under =markdown/=.

- =appendices/= :: Extra-articles that serve as reference for new players and
                   seasoned pilots alike.
- =articles/=   :: Dated reports and theories.
- =authors/=    :: Contributors.
- =chapters/=   :: Most of the content goes there, divided in chapters and
                   pages.
- =partials/=   :: Some content within the Wiki comes from those partials, this
                   avoids having to maintain content alongside code.

The following directories automatically create new pages and routes whenever a
new Markdown file is created: =appendices/=, =articles/=, =chapters/=.

URLs follow the file paths. Follow existing conventions.

*** Mana

The Markdown supports a number of a shorthands in order to easily insert Mana
symbols.

#+BEGIN_SRC
{W}{U}{B}{R}{G} {0}{1}{2}{3} ... {15} ... {20}
{1}{U/B}{U/B} {U/P} {2/U}{2/U}{2/U} {X}{R} {tap} {+1}{+0}{-5}
#+END_SRC

*** Scryfall

You can link cards within content thanks to [[https://scryfall.com/][Scryfall]].
Wrap a card's name with double curly braces for a simple link ={{Doomsday}}=.

Add a =!= to insert a scan instead: ={{!Doomsday}}=. You can also specify the
set: ={{!Doomsday|WTH}}=.

** Contributing with Code

*** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm install

*** Project Layout

                   components.
