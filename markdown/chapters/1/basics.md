# The Basics

This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end the game
directly with a lethal Tendrils of Agony. Fortunately, these piles will also be
the piles that you will execute most frequently and likely win most of your
games with.

There will however, be times where you will build piles that win with Laboratory
Maniac, or build up a higher Storm count with one of several tricks, or build a
pile that plays around Pyroblast on one of your draw spells, or even optimize
for the highest probability of being successful against a Surgical Extraction in
your opponent's hand.

Before this becomes too intimidating, let's first consider the most simple
Doomsday piles. And since this is the starting point for reading about Doomsday
piles in general, we will first explain a bit about the notation that we use
when writing down piles.

## Notation

Mana costs are represented as follows:  
W White - U Blue - B Black - R Red - G Green  
1 one generic mana  
BBB means three black mana  
1UU means two blue mana and one generic mana  
X means a variable amount of any generic mana

---

Consider the following example of a Doomsday pile in this notation:

> Cantrip in hand - BBB+UUU (6) - 7 Storm  
> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}}  

This means that IU is the top card and BW is the bottom card. BBB+UUU represents
the mana cost (Doomsday + Cantrip + Ideas Unbound), (6) is the total converted
mana cost required to complete the pile. 7 Storm represents the amount of Storm
that executing this pile will generate, this includes the Doomsday you've cast
to create this pile as well as the cantrip and the Tendrils of Agony that you
wish for at the end of the pile.

## Basic Doomsday Piles

The Doomsday piles that we will explain here are all based on using either Ideas
Unbound or Infernal Contract as the big draw spell. There is some division in
terms of decklists so we'll attempt to explain piles for each of the 2 major
decklists.

There are some key rules you can use to help remember things like Storm count.
If the intended pile is meant to win without passing the turn then you always
have 1 Storm to begin with from Doomsday itself. Additionally if all cards used
in the Doomsday pile are spells you can cast, then you get to add 5 Storm from
that. Breaking down the card sets of pre-pile, pile and wish targets helps the
mind easily compute what Storm count you will end up with from a certain line of
play.

### Single Cantrip Piles

There are basically two variants to this pile. You either have a cantrip that
draws a single card in hand ready to cast, or a Conjurer's Bauble in play. For
the moment, the difference does not really matter and we'll just assume that you
have a Ponder in hand and U to cast it.

#### Ideas Unbound

> Cantrip in hand - BBB+UUU (5) - 7 Storm  
> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}}  

1. Cast Doomsday and build the pile above
2. Cast Cantrip from hand, draw IU
3. Cast IU, draw LED, LED, SW
4. Cast LED
5. Cast LED
6. Activate SW, hold priority crack LEDs for BBB+RRR, draw (BW)
7. Cast BW fetching ToA
8. Cast ToA

This pile has cost you BBB+UU and 2 life and results in 7 Storm, that is 14
lifeloss. Note that UU is often paid for by a Lion's Eye Diamond. With a Dark
Ritual (to cast Doomsday) and a Lion's Eye Diamond preceding the Doomsday you
already up to 18 lifeloss. Add in a Duress or an extra ritual beforehand and
they're dead.  
If you are low on life you'll need more mana to exchange the SW with a different cantrip.

#### Infernal Contract

> Cantrip in hand - BBB+UBBB (7) - 7 Storm  
> {{!IC}} {{!LP}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!ToA}}  

1. Cast Doomsday and build the pile above
2. Cast cantrip, draw IC
3. Cast IC, draw LP, DR, DR, ToA
4. Cast LP
5. Cast DR, DR
6. Cast ToA

This pile costs BBB+UBBB, requires you have at least 2 life post-Doomsday, and
results in 7 Storm. Like with Ideas Unbound, the mana cost for the draw spell
(BBB) can be - and often is - paid for by a Lion's Eye Diamond in response to
the first cantrip.

### Double Cantrip Piles

#### Ideas Unbound

> SW, SW in hand - BBB+1 (4) - 7 Storm  
> {{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}}  


1. Cast Doomsday and build the pile above
2. Activate SW, draw LED
3. Cast LED
4. Activate SW, hold priority crack LED for UUU, draw IU
5. Cast IU, draw LP, LED, BW
6. Cast LP
7. Cast LED, Crack LP for R
8. Cast BW, hold priority crack LED for BBB, fetch ToA
9. Cast ToA.

This pile has cost only BBB+1 and 4 life to execute and results in 7 Storm. This
pile is quite efficient when it comes to mana. We use the second cantrip in hand
to draw a Lion's Eye Diamond before executing the rest of the pile and use that
Lion's Eye Diamond to pay for much of the rest of the pile. We basically turn
our additional Street Wraith into a Lion's Eye Diamond with Doomsday.

One difficulty with this pile is that Ideas Unbound actually draws Burning Wish
before we can sacrifice the second Lion's Eye Diamond in the pile to produce red
mana. Therefore, one of the Lion's Eye Diamonds in the pile is replaced with a
Lotus Petal, which together with one blue mana left from the first Lion's Eye
Diamond pays for the Burning Wish. The second Lion's Eye Diamond is sacrificed
for three black mana and pays for all but 1 mana of Tendrils of Agony.

#### Infernal Contract

> CB on board, Pre in hand - BBB+U1 (5) - 8 Storm  
> {{!LED}} {{!IC}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!BW}}  

1. Cast Doomsday and build the above pile
2. Cast Pre, draw LED
3. Cast LED, crack it for BBB
4. Activate CB targeting LED, draw IC
5. Cast IC, draw LED, LP, BW, LED
6. Cast LED, LED, LP
8. Cast BW, hold priority cracking LEDs for BBBBBB, fetching ToA
9. Cast ToA

Double cantrip piles with Infernal Contract require a Conjurer's Bauble, since
if you can't put a card back into your deck you'll deck yourself when you try to
draw 4.

## Variations

That's it for the basic and most common piles that end with Tendrils of Agony.
There are many variations of each pile and it doesn't really make sense to list
them all. In each of the above piles you may replace Street Wraith with a
Ponder, you simply need the extra blue mana to pay for it. Also of note, the use
of Conjurer's Bauble to draw into the piles allows for lower mana or life costs
but does result in less Storm being generated during the play line.

The most important part of learning how to cast Doomsday, is to think how you
would like to cast a lethal Tendrils of Agony, and then think of the cards
you'll need to get there. Doomsday is essentially a 5 cards tutor.

The trick is to try not to think of the specifics too much. Try to break
everything down into resources. The key ones are the cards you hold in hand, the
mana available, any other cards in play like Conjurer's Bauble and your deck
construction. As you get more familiar with these factors you can then start to
consider your opponent as a factor and become more experienced in generating
piles on the fly to fit whatever gameplay scenario you might come across.

This is only a small subset of the types of piles you'll require, but these
basic forms are the foundation for other piles you'll encounter. In later
chapters, you'll learn tricks for increasing storm count, swapping cards into
your piles with Brainstorm, and crafting piles that can win through certain
types of disruption.

## Summary

1. You generally need a card that lets you draw most of your pile.
2. Lethal Storm via Tendrils of Agony is the most common win condition for the
   deck.
3. Holding priority when cantripping with LED in play is key, make sure to get
   into this habit.

## Get Started

You now have sufficient information to start practicing! Just take a proven
decklist and start goldfishing trying to figure out what piles to build and how
to execute them. There are several documents available that list Doomsday piles
which you can use to get to know more piles. These are outdated as they precede
the Gitaxian Probe ban, but you may find them helpful nonetheless. See the
[DDFT Pile Document]
(https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/ddft-pileDoc/blob/master/README.md) for a more
basic list of different piles.
