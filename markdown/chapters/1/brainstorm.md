title: Brainstorm in Doomsday
---

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful spells available in the Legacy format at
this time. There have been numerous articles written on this *seemingly
innocuous at first glance* one mana cantrip. I will be glossing over the main
discussion of this card and instead focus on the specifics of using it as a part
of or to initiate your doomsday piles. In many cases it can be used as any other
cantrip, but it has unique applications to Doomsday piles, allowing you to swap
cards in hand for cards in the pile.

One of the more difficult things of playing Doomsday Storm combo is recognizing
situations where you have the resources to win. Beginning players often start
out with learning only a few piles by heart. While this helps with getting
started, there will be many chances to win that they will miss out on.

Let's discuss some examples:

You have {{U}} available. You have just cast Doomsday so Storm count is 1. Your
hand is BS and BW. Let's assess what we have and look at 2 of the most basic of
piles to compare with, one using IU and one using IC:

> BS, BW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{UUU}} - 7 Storm

<pile>{{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!BW}}</pile>

> BS, BW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1UBBB}} - 8 Storm

<pile>{{!IC}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!BW}}</pile>

Brainstorm can act as a simple cantrip into a pile, but it can do better here.
We have a potential finisher in hand and we can use the BS to insert it into the
pile. This lets us save a slot in the pile to play around, swapping it for extra
mana, etc.

## Example 1

> BS, BW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1U}} - 8 Storm

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!LED}}</pile>

1. Cast Doomsday, building the pile above
2. Cast BS, draw LED, IU, SW and put back BW, IU
3. Cast LED
4. Activate SW, hold priority cracking LED for {{UUU}}, draw IU
5. Cast IU, draw BW, LP, LED
6. Cast LED
7. Cast LP
8. Cast BW, hold priority and crack LED for {{BBB}}, get ToA
9. Cast ToA

You can see that this not only decreases the total cost of the pile by 1 mana,
but also drastically changes the amount blue mana needed. This is useful, since
it lets Brainstorm act like a Lion's Eye Diamond, *producing* {{UU}} mana for
Ideas Unbound. It also increases the storm by 1 compared to the basic pile,
since you get an extra spell in the pile.

## Example 2

> BS, BW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1UB}} - 9 Storm


<pile>{{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}}</pile>

1. Cast Doomsday, building the pile above
2. Cast BS, draw IC, DR, LP, put back BW, LP
3. Cast DR, IC, draw LP, BW, LED, LED
4. Cast LED, LED, LP
5. Cast BW, hold priority and crack LEDs for {{BBBBBB}}, get ToA
6. Cast ToA

In this example, you can see that the Storm count is again increased, as well as
the amount of black mana needed decreased. Here, Brainstorm is letting you swap
the BW for a DR to cast IC.

## Example 3

> BS, ToA in hand - {{BBB}} + {{U}} - 7 Storm

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!SW}} {{!DR}} {{!LP}}</pile>

It follows the same lines of play as the above examples but does not require LED
after the initial one used to cast IU as LP, DR and the {{U}} remaining after IU
is enough to cast ToA.

Similarly, with BS and ToA in hand, you can make a pile with IC. We leave that
as an exercise for the reader.

Sometimes, we can get around the IU LED mana restriction simply by having extra
cards in our hands. Notice that in the example above we drew IU only to put it
back with Brainstorm, which is not very useful by itself. If we already had IU
in hand, we could draw any card of our choice from the pile and put back IU.
Since we get to put back two cards, we can put back IU and any other card in
hand to effectively use Brainstrom as a draw-3 spell.

The reason this trick does not work for when we have BW in hand is that we can
only put back two cards with BS, if those cards have to be IU and BW we cannot
exchange any additional cards in hand with cards in the pile.

Say we have BS, IU, and any one card in hand. We cast Doomsday and build:

> BS, IU, X in hand - {{BBB}} + {{U}} - 8 Storm

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}}</pile>

1. Cast Doomsday, building the pile above
2. Cast BS, draw LED, LED, SW and replace X, IU
3. Cast LED
4. Cast LED
5. Activate SW, hold priority and crack LEDs for {{UUURRR}}, draw IU
6. Cast IU draw X, LED, BW
7. Cast LED
8. Cast BW, hold priority and crack LED for {{BBB}}, get ToA
9. Cast ToA

Obviously Storm can be increased by 1 if you are able to cast X prior to BW.

## Summary

1. You can use BS to exchange resources between your hand and the pile.
2. Don't fixate on specific lines, just remember general rules.
