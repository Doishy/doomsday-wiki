title: Doomsday Versus Hate
---

Part of the appeal of Doomsday as a card and as a deck is its flexibility. Doomsday allows you to tutor up just the right set of five cards to pull out a win from a wide variety of situations. Some hate that other storm combo decks would struggle against, Doomsday can beat rather easily. Of course there are things Doomsday struggles with but we'll discuss ways to fight through all kinds of hate. This will be far from comprehensive but it should give you a strong basis for how to approach different types of interaction from your opponents.

Generally when thinking about different types of interaction and combo-hate your opponent might have, it is useful to break it down into categories that have similar techniques for fighting individual cards in them. We'll use 3 main categories: Countermagic, Discard, Permanants, and a 4th Miscellaneous category which will cover cards that don't fit nicely into the others.

## Fighting through Countermagic

Throughought the history of Legacy, roughly 50% of decks at any given time have played the card Force of Will. Countermagic is the most common type of interaction/hate your opponent will have for you, and so you must be prepared to play against it. Due to how common countermagic is, the deck is well prepared for the fight.

Discard spells and Veil of Summer will be your primary tools against countermagic. This makes the basics of playing against countermagic relatively straightforward. Try to resolve a Veil or hit your opponent with some discard before you try to go off. If you can simply get rid of all your opponent's countermagic, then you can combo freely. Against "soft" counters like Daze and Spell Pierce, you can beat them by simply having extra mana, via rituals or plenty of lands. What can you do though if they have "harder" counters that you can't get rid of?

### Example 1

One thing to consider is using a pass-the-turn pile. Lets say your opponent lets you resolve Doomsday but still has a Force of Will. You could use a pass-the-turn pile like this:

> Ponder in hand - {{UUUB}}, 2 life

<row variant="pile">{{!TS}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

You draw Thoughtseize for turn, take the Force from your opponent's hand, and then Ponder into the rest of the pile to win with Oracle. This type of pile can work against many kinds of interaction, but it's really only effective if they have just one card you care about.

### Example 2

Another option if your opponent has something like Flusterstorm is to avoid casting lots of instants and sorceries. If you're playing multiple {{Street Wraith}}, a pile like this can completely invalidate Flusterstorm (assuming Doomsday resolves):

> {{UU}}, 4 life

<row variant="pile"> {{!SW}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} </row>

This can be executed as a pass-the-turn pile, where you never have to cast another Fluster-able spell after Doomsday, or if you have a cantrip in hand you can do it all in one turn and hope they don't counter the cantrip. If they do, simply win next turn.

### Example 3

What about something like Pyroblast? Ideas Unbound and Thassa's Oracle are both blue, so this poses some difficulty. Fortunately, the sideboard gives us some options to work with. 

> LED, BW in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1R}}, min. 12 life pre-DD - 9 Storm

<row variant="pile"> {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!BW}} </row>

The Draw-4 in the sideboard lets you use Burning Wish as a "cantrip" into your pile, and you can storm off without ever casting a blue spell. The life cost is hefty, since you halve your life total twice and then pay 2 life, but the key point here is that it is possible.

### Example 4

How about Stifle? Stifle is unaffected by Veil of Summer, stops both ways you'd try to win (Oracle and storm), but it won't stop you from drawing your pile. 

> Ponder in hand - {{UUUB}}, 2 life

<row variant="pile"> {{!IU}} {{!Dur}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}} </row>

If you're not worried about your spells being countered, you can move the discard spell deeper into the pile. Ponder into Ideas Unbound and cast it to draw a discard spell, LED, and Wraith. cast the discard spell to take Stifle, and then you're free to cycle into Oracle.

## Playing Through Discard

It is common to face discard in the legacy format, especially from other combo decks and non-blue midrange. Discard comes in a few varieties, a la {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Hymn to Tourach}}, and {{Liliana of the Veil}}, but you fight through them all in fundamentally the same way. Pass-the-turn piles are a powerful weapon against discard. They don't need to rely on cards in hand after Doomsday, and they require minimal initial input, i.e. a single hardcast Doomsday may be all you need.

### Example 1

> {{UU}}, 2 life

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}} </row>

You've seen this pile before, but we bring it up again here for its simplcity. It is efficient and requires no cards in hand, making it invulnerable to discard.

### Example 2

>  Echo, 1 other card in hand - {{0}}

<row variant="pile"> {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}} {{!LP}} </row>

This is similar to some Echo pile examples, except it is presented as a pass-the-turn pile. It doesn't matter if they hit you with discard, since you want the Echo in your graveyard anyway and the other card in hand doesn't matter. You'll untap, draw LED, flashback Echo, and win with Oracle. Note too the order of the pile here. It actually matters, since if something happens nad you can't Echo, you  may still be able to win by simply passing a few more turns before you play Oracle.

Just in general, Echo is a strong card against decks that primarily interact with hand hate. You can play out LEDs to protect them from discard, and then later on use an Echo for value to simply refill your hand. Similarly, if an Echo gets discarded to something like a Hymn or Liliana, you can simply flash it back to restock as soon as you have enough mana.

## Playing Through Permanent-based hate

Permanent based hate is among the most annoying you will have to face. This section will be rather long, because we'll address techniques for beating the most common permanents

### Chalice of the Void

Chalice is the most common piece of permanent hate you will face so knowing how to deal with it is a must. In the sideboard, you will have options to remove it, potentially even ones you can wish for, so we'll focus on piles that can win with it still on the battlefield.

#### Chalice on 0

Chalice on 0 can be tough to deal with. It doesn't hinder your ability to assemble your combo, but most piles rely on 0-cost artifacts which substantially complicates things.

> Chalice on 0, Ponder in hand - {{BBB} + {{UUU}}, 4 life

<row variant="pile"> {{!SW}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}} {{!Isl}} {{!Isl}} </row>

With 2 Street Wraith in the deck, you can avoid casting any 0-cmc spells. 

> Chalice on 0, Ponder in hand, land drop remaining - {{BBB}} + {{UUUU}}, 4 life

<row variant="pile"> {{!IU}} {{!Isl}} {{!TO}} {{!SW}} {{!Isl}} </row>

This pile works without the need for Street Wraith. You never have to cycle it, that slot could be anything, but here it gets you to 0 cards in the deck. You can use a land drop to make {{U}} to help cast Oracle, but it still requires a ton of blue mana, making things difficult.

> Chalice on 0, Ponder in hand, {{BBB}} + {{UBBBBR}} - 8 Storm

<row variant="pile"> {{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!BW}} </row>

> Chalice on 0, Ponder in hand, {{BBB}} + {{UUUBR}}, 2 life - 7 Storm

<row variant="pile"> {{!IU}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!SW}} {{!BW}} </row>

Storm kills are theoretically possible through a chalice on 0, although they require quite a bit of mana.

#### Chalice on 1

Chalice on 1 makes it tough to assemble your combo, since it turns off your cantrips, but it does very little to prevent you from winning if you can actualy cast Doomsday.

> {{UU}}, 2 life

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}} </row>

The simplest pass-the-turn pile possible contains no 1-cost spells. You've seen this one before.

> Echo, LED in hand - {{BBB}} - 10 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}} </row>

Echo piles can win with Tendrils without ever casting a 1-cost spell.

> BW, LED in hand - {{BBB}} + {{1R}}, 12 - 9 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!BW}} </row>

Another storm kill that doesn't use 1-cost spells. Wishing for the Draw-4 eliminates the need for a 1-mana cantrip. This one has a hefty life cost though.
