title: Winning Without Doomsday
---

One advantage that DDFT has over other Doomsday variants is that it can reliably win without casting the namesake card, and can even do it quickly. This can be a big deal, since it means you have options. You don't fold to a single {{Surgical Extraction}} on the right card. You can win through a card like {{Ashiok, Dream Render}}, or go off all at once in the face of a 
{{Narset, Parter of Veils}}. You can pick the best combo engine for the situation and dodge the potential chokepoint that is the card Doomsday.

There are 3 main categories of non-Doosmday wins and we will explore each of them. Winning without Doomsday is arguably less complicated than winning with Doomsday, although it's often easier to assmeble a hand that wins with Doomsday. If you've played other storm, most of this should be familiar to you. 

## Empty the Warrens
Empty the Warrens as an alternative win condition is the most straightforward way of winning without Doomsday. You can easily make 10 or more goblins, and do so as early as the first turn. Typically you'll want to do this early in the game before your opponent establishes a board presence, but it can still be effective later on aggainst threat-light decks like Delver. Consider the following situation:

> Turn 2, Underground Sea on Board - Hand:

<row variant="hand">{{!DR}} {{!Veil}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!BW}}</row>

You can play out your mana artifacts, cast Veil, and then the Dark Ritual. Cast Burning Wish holding priority, and crack the LED for {{RRR}}. Along with the {{BB}} leftover from the Ritual, you have enough to cast Empty the Warrens to make 14 Goblins. Killing like this is extremely simple, but do not underestimate its effectiveness. Early in the game, most decks will simply not be able to handle that many goblins. Other combo decks may be able to race goblins, and decks with Stoneforge Mystic may be able to use Batterskull to stabilize if you don't get a lot of goblins down quickly enough, but other decks will struggle. While you're typically looking to make more than 10 goblins, as few as 8 can put a lot of pressure on a deck like Delver.

It is common to play multiple copies of Empty in your sideboard, for the purpose of bringing a few copies in. Naturally drawing and casting Empty the Warrens, rather than Wishing for it, is a great tool against blue decks. Force of Will and Daze lose effectiveness against a storm spell cast from hand, since even if they can counter 1 or 2 copies, you can still have 5 more. Empties are also reasonable in multiples against blue decks. You can make a small goblins horde, perhaps as few as 6, with relatively low resource input. Your opponent then needs to spend resources to deal with the tokes, while you get in a bit of damage and build up to another Empty. In this way, you can grind out slow control decks, perhaps finishing them off with a small Tendrils or Grapeshot if they deal with the second goblin army.

## Alternative Storm Engines

The most common alternative engine in DDFT is Echo of Eons, since it has substantial applications in piles on top of playing a role as a storm engine in its own right. The basic idea of using Echo as an engine could not be more straightforward. Make a bunch of mana, crack an LED, flashback Echo, and hope you draw more mana and a Burning Wish. With this in mind, we should focus more on the caveats of this technique.

When going off with Echo of Eons, mana is going to be your biggest constraint. This deck does not play as many free mana sources as a deck like TES, so you typically want as much mana floating as possible after casting Echo. While you can theoretically win with no mana floating, it is simply unlikely. Ideally, you'll have access to at least {{UBR}}, so you can cast rituals, you have red for Burning Wish, and blue in case you need to cantrip to find more mana or Burning Wish. Keep in mind that you are likely to draw a land, so if you have a land drop you can use this to generate mana after Echo.
