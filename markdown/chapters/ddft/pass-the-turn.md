title: Pass-the-Turn Piles
---

First of all, why would you ever want to cast Doomsday and then pass the turn?
The answer is simple: when you can't win otherwise. It should be clear that pass-the-turn
piles are rarely a desirable plan as there are significant risks involved in paying half your life
and saying "Go."

One of the main uses of pass-the-turn piles is
to become immune to discard. Under the right conditions, you can cast Doomsday, pass,
and untap with all the resources you need to win on the battlefield or the top of your deck,
thereby invalidating an opponen't interaction. 

Another situation in which you may choose to do a pass the turn pile is when you don't have a
draw effect, but your life total is not threatened. Here you can use your draw step as the cantrip. 
This also reduces the amount of mana you need to go off in one turn.

## Pass-the-Turn Piles with Thassa's Oracle

Thassa's Oracle is a substantial improvement to the deck, not least of all because of the extremely cheap
pass-the-turn piles it enables. Let's look at a very basic example.

> {{UU}}

<pile>{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</pile>

Imagine you have an Island and and Underground Sea on board, Dark Ritual and Doomsday in hand. You can
Ritual into Doomsday, pass the turn, and win with a mere 2 blue mana and 2 life when you untap. In fact you could
conceivably cast Doomsday on turn 1, and make your second land drop to generate {{UU}}.

> {{BBB}}

<pile>{{!IC}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

This is essentially the same pile, but with Infernal Contract as the draw spell. It has a different cost,
but it's worth noting that this could be paid with a Ritual.

> Lion's Eye Diamond on the board - {{0}}

<pile>{{!SW}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

If you have an LED on the battlefield, you can win for just 2 life, no mana needed. This can be very valuable, because
there may be times where you lose lands after passing the turn. Invalidating mana-denial and discard can be valuable against
a deck like Pox, which, while uncommon, you will surely encounter at some point.
>Ponder in hand - {{U}}

<pile>{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</pile>

This pile is similar to the last, but swaps the locations of the cantrip and the LED. You might use a pile like this when
you are constrained on mana and don't have enough resources to go off all in one turn. For example, with a single Underground Sea,
you could cast Dark Ritual and Doomsday on one turn, and Ponder on the next, where you wouldn't have the mana to do it all
in one turn.


## Pass-the-Turn Piles with Tendrils of Agony

Generating a lethal storm count can be tricky when you have to pass the turn. A standard five card pile ending with Burning Wish
for Tendrils will only generate 6 Storm on its own, which is unlikely to be lethal. Having additional Rituals or mana artifacts
in hand can help add to storm count, but you still need to be getting up to 9 or 10 storm to kill under most circumstances.
Thassa's Oracle has made it so these kinds of piles are often unecessary, but if you are unlucky you may find yourself with Oracle
exiled, nothing but a Doomsday in hand, and you'll be glad you read this section.

> LP on board - {{UU}}

<pile>{{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!Echo}}</pile>

> 5 lands in play - {{1BBBB}} - 11 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!RoF}} {{!CR}} {{!CB}} {{!ToA}}</row>

This pile works by using CB to cast ToA twice, using CB to rebuy it. To do it
from no cards in hand requires a ton of lands on board, as well as {{Rain of
Filth}} which not every list plays. However, with some mana producers in hand
the onboard requirements are easier to manage.

> DR, LED in hand - {{1B}} - 15 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!LED}} {{!DR}} {{!CB}} {{!ToA}}</row>

If you have Past in Flames in the sideboard you can use that as an engine to
generate lethal storm.

> DR in hand - {{BBRR}} - 10 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!BW}} {{!ToA}}</row>

This pile doesn't require the use of an artifact meaning it can beat a Null Rod
or a {{Phyrexian Revoker}}, although having an LED available will make producing
{{RR}} easier.

You can also use Burning Wish to up your Storm count.

> {{1BBBBR}} or {{1BBBRR}} - 7 Storm

<row variant="pile">{{!BW}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LP}} {{!BW}}</row>

The first BW finds IC in the sideboard to draw the rest of the pile. The second
burning wish fetches ToA. A ritual or LED left in hand will help boost Storm
count and make the mana cost easier.

## Summary

1. You don't always have to win the turn you cast Doomsday
2. Pass-the-turn piles are effective when low on a resource (cards or mana, but
   not both)
3. PTT piles leave you susceptible to disruption
4. There are tricks you can use to ensure you can build up enough Storm so you
   don't always have to rely on LM
