title: General Sideboard Principles
---

In this chapter we will present the concepts and elements to
consider when building your sideboard and against some of the 
more resilient archetypes to meta shifts. Obviously with
new printings or different metagames these concepts may change
so please consider what decks you expect to face and amend
accordingly. Some of this will overlap with what is discussed
in the [Playing Around Interaction](chapters/meandeck/Playing Around Interaction) 
section.
