title: General Sideboard Principles
---

In this chapter we will present the concepts and elements to
consider when building your sideboard and against some of the 
more resilient archetypes to meta shifts. Obviously with
new printings or different metagames these concepts may change
so please consider what decks you expect to face and amend
accordingly. Some of this will overlap with what is discussed
in the [Playing Around Interaction](chapters/meandeck/Playing Around Interaction) 
section.

## Your deck construction

### List Assumptions

There will need to be some assumptions made on the list you are
playing, even despite flex slots available. These assumptions 
are that you will run, at a minimum, the following cards in
your main deck configuration:

 - 4 Doomsday
 - 4 Dark Ritual
 - 4 Daze
 - 4 Force of Will
 - 1-2 Street Wraith
 - 1 Edge of Autumn
 - 1 Lion's Eye Diamond
 - 2-3 Lotus Petal
 - 3-4 "Other protection slots" such as discard effects or Veil of Summer
 - 1-2 Predict / Ideas Unbound
 - 1-2 "Additional Search" such as Lim-Dul's Vault or Personal Tutor
 - 4 Ponder
 - 4 Brainstorm
 - 4 Preordain
 - 8 Fetchlands
 - 2-3 Basic Lands
 - 5-6 Dual Lands
 
 ### Sideboard Tools
 
 Generally, when constructing your sideboard, you need to both have a good 
 grasp on what the metagame you are expecting to face looks like and to 
 have cards that are applicable to multiple match-ups where possible. 
 Trying to run *silver bullets* for archetypes which you have a bad
 match-up with, but whose meta penetration is very low, is a misuse
 of potential card slots. Likewise, dedicating too many slots to a deck
 that is considered tier 1 could mean you get overrun by all the other
 decks that you are likely to face in a normal, healthy metagame.
 
 Most sideboard tools at your disposal can be attributed to dealing with
 certain types of opposing interaction or game plans, although in some
 cases, there are slots that fulfil multiple roles. Knowing what weaknesses
 you need to sure up in what match-ups, and when to respect something and
 when to accept / ignore it, is a key skill in general deck construction.
 
 The following categories should be consider broad sub-groups and, like
 our maindeck configuration, are based on some assumptions of what is being
 run. As the deck can have many *splash colour* options it is good to be 
 familiar with what tools you might be able to work with to achieve an 
 effect under each group in order to have the required tools available.
