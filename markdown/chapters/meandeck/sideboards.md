title: General Sideboard Principles
---

In this chapter we will present the concepts and elements to
consider when building your sideboard and against some of the 
more resilient archetypes to meta shifts. Obviously with
new printings or different metagames these concepts may change
so please consider what decks you expect to face and amend
accordingly. Some of this will overlap with what is discussed
in the [Playing Around Interaction](chapters/meandeck/Playing Around Interaction) 
section.

## Your deck construction

### List Assumptions

There will need to be some assumptions made on the list you are
playing, even despite flex slots available. These assumptions 
are that you will run, at a minimum, the following cards in
your main deck configuration:

 - 4 Doomsday
 - 4 Dark Ritual
 - 4 Daze
 - 4 Force of Will
 - 1-2 Street Wraith
 - 1 Edge of Autumn
 - 1 Lion's Eye Diamond
 - 2-3 Lotus Petal
 - 3-4 "Other protection slots" such as discard effects or Veil of Summer
 - 1-2 Predict / Ideas Unbound
 - 1-2 "Additional Search" such as Lim-Dul's Vault or Personal Tutor
 - 4 Ponder
 - 4 Brainstorm
 - 4 Preordain
 - 8 Fetchlands
 - 2-3 Basic Lands
 - 5-6 Dual Lands
 
 ### Sideboard Tools
 
 Generally, when constructing your sideboard, you need to both have a good 
 grasp on what the metagame you are expecting to face looks like and to 
 have cards that are applicable to multiple match-ups where possible. 
 Trying to run *silver bullets* for archetypes which you have a bad
 match-up with, but whose meta penetration is very low, is a misuse
 of potential card slots. Likewise, dedicating too many slots to a deck
 that is considered tier 1 could mean you get overrun by all the other
 decks that you are likely to face in a normal, healthy metagame.
 
 Most sideboard tools at your disposal can be attributed to dealing with
 certain types of opposing interaction or game plans, although in some
 cases, there are slots that fulfil multiple roles. Knowing what weaknesses
 you need to sure up in what match-ups, and when to respect something and
 when to accept / ignore it, is a key skill in general deck construction.
 
 The following categories should be consider broad sub-groups and, like
 our maindeck configuration, are based on some assumptions of what is being
 run. As the deck can have many *splash colour* options it is good to be 
 familiar with what tools you might be able to work with to achieve an 
 effect under each group in order to have the required tools available.

VS Delver

⁃	-4 FoW, -2 SW, -1 LDV
⁃	+2 Fluster, +2 VoS, +3 Carpet

⁃	Try to race their threats and be a fast and resilient combo deck. 
⁃	Rather than bringing decays/push etc and trying to play a longer game (playing lands to nullify their dazes/pierce etc) I like to be fast. Play all 4 LP main deck and bring carpets from the sideboard to play around their soft counter magic. Upgrade FoW to Fluster and VoS. (I could see keeping some number of FoWs but we end up with too much interaction and they’re the weakest.)
⁃	Cut all the cards that make you lose life (no, not DD..) Street Wraith, LDV and Thoughtseize.
⁃	If you can - try to make an early PTT pile with Cavern of Souls.
⁃	Don’t remove LED. You are losing access to a lot of piles by cutting it and you gain very little. This matchup is often played on tiny margins and LED will help you in situations where you don’t have access to a lot of resources.


VS Chalice

-3 Dur
+3 AD

⁃	Don’t keep hands that are slow and have too many cantrips. You are looking for Doomsday and mana to cast it as soon as possible.
⁃	Discard isn’t very effective unless you are on the play and have it in your opening hand. Leave it in the sideboard. 
⁃	I like to keep Cavern of Souls in the deck as a answer to CotV @2. It’s very effective and easier to use in piles than Abrupt Decay.
⁃	Be aware of Mindbreak Trap.


VS Show & Tell

-1 LED, -1 LP, -1 LDV, -1 X 
+2 Fluster, +2 VoS

⁃	They are playing a A+B(+C) combo deck and our combo is just a single card. They are more likely to have redundant cards in their hand and worse top decks.
⁃	Don’t be the first to pull the trigger unless you’re very sure that you can win the fight. If you force a DD through and pass the turn you must also be able to fight a combo attempt on their turn.
⁃	You will often pass the turn after you resolved Doomsday. It you have the ability to draw into the pile and put TO in your hand, that’s great. Put it into play if your opponent casts Show and Tell.
⁃	I like keeping all the cyclers in the deck to be able to cycle into a FoW on top of the DD pile.
⁃	Generally you can play a longer game but if they are bringing Boseiju you have to be faster.
⁃	Be careful when playing discard spells, sometimes they splash for VoS


VS Thalia decks

-1 CoS, -3 Dur
+1 Massacre, +3 AD

⁃	Don’t keep hands that are slow and have too many cantrips. You are looking for Doomsday and mana to cast it as soon as possible.
⁃	If you’re passing the turn make sure to put enough mana in the pile. Think about Thalia, Wasteland, Rishadan Port or a vialed in Flickerwhisp.
⁃	Think about which hate bears matter in the current game state. If you can beat a Ethersworn Cannonist or Revoker - save your counterspell for something that matters.
⁃	Massacre is a great card to put into piles since it’s so cheap. It is useful especially when passing the turn.


VS Storm

-1 CoS, -1 LP, -1 LDV, -1 SW
+2 Fluster, +0-2 VoS, +0-2 AD

⁃	Against TES I wouldn’t bring Veil of Summer. Most TES lists doesn’t play discard and they can kill you with Grapeshot. I would maybe consider Abrupt Decay for Defense Grid and possibly Hope of Ghirapur.
⁃	If you’re passing the turn be aware that it doesn’t take much to kill you with Tendrils of Agony or Grapeshot. See if you can make a pile that doesn’t die to EoE from TES.


VS Control

-1 LED, -2 LP, -2 DR, -2 Daze, -1 EoA, -1 LDV, -1 SW
+2 Fluster, +2 VoS, +0-3 Carpet, +0-3 AD

⁃	There are many different builds of control decks and you’re going to adjust based on what you see. 
⁃	Carpet gets worse when they can play around it with Astrolabe and it’s terrible against Leovold.
⁃	One of the scarier early plays from them are Sylvan Library and Counterbalance, make sure to have an answer for that.
⁃	You tend to be able to pass the turn multiple times since they don’t pressure your life total much.
⁃	A PTT pile with CoS is difficult for them to interact with. Be aware of cards like Surgical Extraction, Assassins Trophy (destroying a land), Dack Fayden and Predict.


VS Hogaak

-1 CoS, -2 Pre, -3 Dur, -1 IU, -1 SW, 
+4 LotV, +2 VoS, +0-2 AD

⁃	I mulligan aggressively for either a fast turn 1-2 combo or a Leyline.
⁃	We can bring AD for Altar of Dementia and Hedron Crab. If they’re on Jund I might not have AD on the play.
