More than a cantrip to start consuming your piles, Brainstorm can effectively
draw 3 cards at once from said pile unlike other options from your suite of
cantrips.

With limited initial resources, if stranded on mana against Wasteland or
opposing Rishadan Port activations you can still combo out with only a
Brainstorm post-Doomsday as long as you have an extra card in hand to put back.

## Brainstorm Available

> BS, X in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {U}

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pdt}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Brainstorm and put back X then Predict
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Predict
1. Target yourself with Predict naming X and drawing the rest of the pile
1. The Lotus Petal gives you a second {U} to cast TO with an empty library

## Free Cycler Available

The pile is similar, but you don't have a spare {U} this time to cast the
Brainstorm. You can get it with any free cycler by placing a Lotus Petal in
first position of your pile. This works with a blue-land as well if you can
afford the land drop this turn.

> BS, SW, X in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {0}

<row variant="pile">{{!LP}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cycle SW, draw the LP and cast it
1. Cast Brainstorm off LP and put back X then Ponder
1. Cast LED, cycle SW cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw the Ponder
1. Ponder for TO
1. Cast TO with the remaining mana from LED with 1 card left in your library

However that pile leaves you vulnerable to removal your opponent might play in
response to TO's trigger.
