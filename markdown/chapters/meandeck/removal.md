title: Playing Around Removal
---

The trick with Meandeck piles usually isn't the inability to play through
interaction from an opponent. On the contrary, Meandeck can build piles that are
quite resilient. One of the pillars of Meandeck mastery is choosing which
interaction to focus on beating with each pile you build.

Most Meandeck piles try to play around removal.

## Cheating on Devotion

If your opponent deals with TO with its trigger on the stack, you could be
missing on a couple Devotion to {U}. That's why it's important to try and
consume the entirety of your pile before going for it whenever you can,
especially if your opponent is likely to hold removal as you go off.

Note also that your other permanents might provide you with blue devotion:
Baleful Strix, Counterbalance or even Teferi, Time Raveler are a few examples.

With an active fetchland in play as you resolve Doomsday, or sometimes by
putting both a fetchland and a fetch'able land inside the pile, you can
effectively thin further down the size of your library as you move towards
resolving TO.

> Ponder, Island in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {U}{U}{U}

<row variant="pile">{{!BS}} {{!SW}} {{!SW}} {{!Polluted Delta|ONS}} {{!TO}}</row>

1. Cast Ponder to draw BS
1. Cast BS and put back Island then SW
1. Cycle SW to draw the second SW
1. Land Polluted Delta and fetch the Island
1. Cycle SW and play TO with 0 remaining cards

For instance, this pile requires a land drop but plays around the following:

- Chalice of the Void on 0
- Warping Wail
- Unavailability of Predict

Often though, a standard pile starting off with your draw spell of choice will
be enough to negate removal from your opponent.

## Build Durable Piles

Sometimes you might want to go blind and force through removal with redundancy.
{{Unearth}} is one tool to build some durability against removal but most
notably countermagic. It lets you reanimate the TO when countered or when you
name TO itself to Predict to dig into the pile.

> Ponder, Ponder in hand - {B}{B}{B} + {U}{U}

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!Prt}} {{!TO}} {{!Un}} {{!LP}}</row>

At the very least you could put Unearth at the bottom of your pile *just in
case*.

One other way to build redundancy is putting a second copy of Doomsday in your
pile, if anything goes wrong you can always re-cast Doomsday, pay half your life
and try again!
