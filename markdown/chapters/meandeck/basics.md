title: The Basics

This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end the game
directly with a {{Thassa’s Oracle}} trigger. While older versions of Meandeck
used Laboratory Maniac as the primary win-condition, the introduction of TO
allows us to build piles that are more streamlined than ever.

The trick with Meandeck piles usually isn’t the inability to play through
interaction from an opponent. On the contrary, Meandeck can build piles that are
quite resilient. One of the pillars of Meandeck mastery is choosing which
interaction to focus on beating with each pile you build.
