This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end the game
directly with a {{Thassa's Oracle}} trigger. While older versions of Meandeck
used Laboratory Maniac as the primary win-condition, the introduction of TO
allows us to build piles that are more streamlined than ever.

The trick with Meandeck piles usually isn't the inability to play through
interaction from an opponent. On the contrary, Meandeck can build piles that are
quite resilient. One of the pillars of Meandeck mastery is choosing which
interaction to focus on beating with each pile you build.

One standard pile looks like this:

<pile>{{!Pd}} {{!Pn}} {{!SW}} {{!LED}} {{!TO}}</pile>

Post-Doomsday, pick these 5 cards and form a pile with them. Draw into the
Predict, either the same turn or by passing the turn to your opponent. Target
yourself with Predict and name whatever you put in second position in order to
draw both SW and LED. Play the LED and cycle SW while keeping priority. This
lets you crack the LED for {{UUU}} and draw the TO for the win.
