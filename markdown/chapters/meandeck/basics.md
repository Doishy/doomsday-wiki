This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end the game
directly with a {{Thassa's Oracle}} trigger. While older versions of Meandeck
used {{Laboratory Maniac}} as the primary win-condition, the introduction of TO
allows us to build piles that are more streamlined than ever.

As a general rule, in order to win you need to:

1. Resolve Doomsday
1. Draw into your pile
1. Consume enough cards out of the pile so that TO's trigger wins you the game

Often enough, steps 2 and 3 go together while using a *draw spell*. Typically a
draw spell, helps digging into the pile, drawing resources from the pile.

## Predict

> {{BBB}} + {{1U}}

<row variant="pile">{{!Prt}} {{!Pnd}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

Post-Doomsday, pick these 5 cards and form a pile with them. Draw into the
Predict, either the same turn or by passing the turn to your opponent. Target
yourself with Predict and name whatever you put in second position in order to
draw both SW and LED. Play the LED and cycle SW while keeping priority. This
lets you crack the LED for {{UUU}} and draw the TO for the win.

## Ideas Unbound

> {{BBB}} + {{UU}}

<row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!LP}} {{!SW}} {{!TO}}</row>

Likewise, open the pile with IU to draw both the mana and the cycler that will
get TO.

## Other Ways to Draw into the Pile

In the events your draw spell gets exiled, usually by pitching it to Force of
Will or by your opponent's actions, you need another way of drawing into your
pile. With enough initial mana regular cantrips will do just fine.

If short on mana and LED becomes necessary, you need to assemble 2 draw effects.
The first one to draw said LED, and the second one to draw the second card from
your pile while cracking the LED for mana.

> Ponder, Ponder in hand - {{BBB}} + {{UU}}

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!SW}} {{!Pnd}} {{!TO}}</row>

The above pile is much straightforward on purpose, its parts are moving and can
be replaced depending on what parts you already have access to.

For instance, if you already have the LED and a Ponder, you crack the LED for
{{UUU}} in response to the Ponder, giving you enough mana to work with for the
cards in your pile.

> Ponder, LED in hand - {{BBB}} + {{U}}

<row variant="pile">{{!Prt}} {{!Pnd}} {{!SW}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>
