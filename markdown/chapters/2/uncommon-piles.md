# Uncommon Piles

There are a number of less commonly used ways to win the game after Doomsday.
These may no longer be as relevant as they once were, or simply may not come up
often enough in practice to be worth devoting a whole page to, but they are
still worth knowing about. We won't go too deep into these topics, as the basics
should get you through on the rare occasion this knowledge is relevant. There
are a number of other configurations these pile types can take, but this should
get you started.

## Double Doomsday Piles

There may come a time when you need to achieve a high storm count, but Lab Man
is not an option. Perhaps your opponent has a high life total and lots of
removal. One option in such situations is a Double Doomsday pile. As the name
suggests, these involve casting Doomsday twice in one turn, to build a new pile
and recycle cards you cast in your first pile. These piles typically require a
lot of mana and life (especially if you're using IC) but they are still worth
knowing, though they rarely come up.

> CB in play, SW in hand - BBB + 1UUR (7) - 11 Storm  
> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}} {{!BW}}  
> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!SW}} {{!BW}}  

Plays out as follows:

1. Cast Doomsday, building the first pile above
2. Activate SW, draw IU
4. Cast IU, draw LED, LED, BW
5. Cast LED
6. Cast LED
7. Cast BW fetching DD, hold priority and crack LEDs for UUU BBB
7. Cast Doomsday build the second pile above
   - Crack CB targeting nothing, draw IU
8. Cast IU, draw LED, LED, SW
9. Cast LED
10. Cast LED
11. Activate SW, hold priority and crack LEDs for BBB RRR, draw BW
12. Cast BW fetching ToA
13. Cast ToA for 11 storm.

You can do a Double-DD pile with IC, but be aware you need at least 16 life
pre-DD to execute this pile and it requires a silly amount of black mana. Here
is an example of what that might look like:

> DR, Pre in hand - BBB+UBBBBBB1 - 11 Storm  
> {{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!CB}} {{!DD}} {{!ToA}}  
> {{!IC}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!DD}} {{!Pre}}  

1. Cast Doomsday, building the first pile above
2. Cast DR, then Pre to draw IC
3. Cast IC, drawing DR, CB, DD, ToA
4. Cast CB, then DR, then DD, building the second pile above
5. Cast IC again, drawing DR, DR, DD, Pre
6. Cast DR, DR, then ToA

This pile is unlikely to be useful in practice since the cost is so steep.

## Shelldock Isle/Emrakul

The interaction between Doomsday and Shelldock Isle is surprisingly elegant.
Once you resolve Doomsday you automatically fulfill the activation condition on
Shelldock Isle, and also can ensure you hideaway the card you want. Emrakul, the
Aeons Torn is by far the best card to cast off Shelldock Isle, since you will
get an extra turn and can attack to obliterate your opponent's board.

This tech was extremely popular during the height of Miracles' power, since it
was immune to counterspells after Doomsday resolved. In the current metagame,
there are not enough decks that are weak to this strategy to make it worth
spending the sideboard slots, so it fell out of favor. It could certainly be a
valid metagame choice depending on what decks you expect to face.

A simple version of the pile looks like this:

> Enough life to live for 2 turns post-DD  
> {{!SI}} {{!EM}} {{!Isl}} {{!Dur}} {{!LM}}  

1. Cast Doomsday, build the pile above, pass the turn.
2. Draw and play Shelldock Isle, hideaway Emrakul, pass the turn
3. Draw and play Island, activate Shelldock Isle, cast Emrakul, take another
   turn.
4. Cast Duress if you can, attack with Emrakul.
5. Attack again next turn if needed. Lab Man serves as a backup plan in case
   they're not dead yet.

The first 2 cards may be the only ones required to win so we have 3 extra cards
to build some redundancy, interaction and backup plans into our pile.

If you have SI in hand and a land drop available, you can do this pile and only
pass 1 turn.

If you suspect the opponent has a way to interact with the order of your pile,
like JTMS's +2, you can modify the pile slightly to play around this:

> {{!CB}} {{!SI}} {{!Em}} {{!Dur}} {{!LM}}

CB on top means SI won't get fatesealed, and you can put DD on the bottom with
CB to draw SI and ensure you have enough cards in your library to not deck
yourself before you can attack for lethal.

## Time Spiral Piles

Time Spiral was a common sideboard card in older Doomsday lists, predating the
rise of SDT Miracles. It can still be used to make functional piles, and is a
strong wishboard card in its own right, but giving your opponent a fresh 7 in
our blue-dominated format is undesirable. For this reason the card sees little
to no play, but is presented here for its historical interest.

The cost listed in square brackets \[..\] is assumingly paid for by the lands that
are untapped by Time Spiral.

A simple example of a pile that uses Time Spiral is as follows:

> Cantrip, X in hand - UU+1R+\[1R\] (4) - 11 Storm  
> {{!IU}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!BW}} {{!BW}}  

The first wish fetches Time Spiral, which untaps lands that let you play the
second Burning Wish to fetch Tendrils.

Note that if you have no other cards in hand or your post-Doomsday graveyard
resolving Time Spiral will kill you. The Doomsday you've cast to build this pile
typically ends up as the only card in your graveyard, with 5 cards in your pass
the turn pile this adds up to 6. However, the Burning Wish used to wish for Time
Spiral exiles itself, so that's only 5 cards. That's is why the pile lists 'X in
hand', the extra card is needed to ensure you don't deck yourself when you cast
Time Spiral. If you can cast spell X after Time Spiral, your storm count can be
high than what is listed. Also note, that the listed cost assumes that you can
produce 1R with the lands that you untap with Time Spiral.

You can also use Time Spiral in pass-the-turn piles, just note that you'll need
an additional extra card in hand to not deck yourself.

## Summary

1. These piles are useful to know, for their historical significance and
   occasional practical use.
2. These piles aren't going to come up all that often in a typical game, so
   don't feel you need to memorize them.
