# The Doomsday Codex

The Doomsday Codex is intended to be the most complete and up to date work on
how to cast the card named Doomsday in the Doomsday storm combo deck (DDFT) in
the Legacy format of Magic: the Gathering.

There is actually much more to how to play the deck, but understanding how to
cast the namesake card of the deck is a pretty big piece of the puzzle. This
document is specifically not a 'primer' as you often see for other decks in
Legacy, because primers generally become outdated rather quickly and are more
about card choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so on. The Doomsday Codex is
there to help people to really understand how the deck works and can win in
various scenarios.

An overview of Doomsday piles is actually collected in a separate document,
which is called [The Doomsday Pile Document](/appendices/piles/). The pile
document only lists a selection of the possible piles, while the Doomsday Codex
focuses the theory behind the piles. How to build them, when to build them, why
the pile is build up like that, how to play around stuff, how to sequence your
spells correctly, and so on.

Another related collection of articles is the
[Doomsday-Library](https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/Doomsday-Library). This is a
collection of archived articles that have become obsolete, for example due to
the format evolving, or because certain cards have been banned.
