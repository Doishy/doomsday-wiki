# Piles with Experimental Frenzy Doomsday - A Beginner's Guide to Becoming a Barista

*By Knox*

---

Since the banning of Gitaxian probe on July 2nd of 2018, Doomsday had not seen
much action. Probe as a free draw spell was integral to the function of the deck
as it had existed before the ban, and the deck took a large hit.

Much faith in the deck was lost, and we waited in the wings for a new card to be
printed to finally replace the spot of probe.

That card turned out to be Experimental Frenzy.

James, also known as Ape Of Justice on the Doomsday Discord server, got 6th
place in a MTGO challenge on April 14th, 2019 with Experimental Frenzy Doomsday.

## Piles

Piles with DDEFT are much easier than the prior D4, Probe, or Top versions (in
my opinion).

With Experimental Frenzy in play, casting Doomsday wins the game.

{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!DD|A25}} {{!ToA}}

With this pile, you can get infinite storm.

1. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
2. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
3. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
4. Cast DD, LED LED LED ToA DD
5. Repeat

If you do not have an Experimental Frenzy in play, casting Doomsday wins if you
have 2RU and a cantrip in hand using an Act on Impulse pile. An example of this
line.

{{!AoI}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!Pre}} {{!ToA}}

1. Cast Brainstorm, put back both LEDs, storm 5
2. Cast Act on Impulse, exiling LED LED Preordain, storm 6
3. Cast both LEDs, crack for UUUBBB and cast Preordain, storm 9
4. Draw Tendrils and drain them for 20

These are probably the most common piles, but there are variations on them. For
example, take this PTT pile where you need 4 mana on the next turn.

{{!EF}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!DD|A25}} {{!ToA}}

You can use this pile when you have 4 mana sources in play. If you have a
Conjurer's Bauble in play, this is a win, if not, this is a PTT pile.

If your opponent has Phyrexian Revoker on LED or a Chalice of the Void set to 0
and you have a Frenzy in play, you can use this infinite storm pile utilizing
Dark Ritual as an alternative to LED.

{{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!DR}} {{!DD}} {{!ToA}}

It does the same thing as the other piles, but it doesn't use LED.

Due to the fact that we only need to be making 4 mana each time we loop doomsday
to eventually cast Tendrils, the pile can be altered to fit in a discard spell
or bounce spell.

{{!Dur}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!DD}} {{!ToA}}

**OR**

{{!LED}} {{!Dur}} {{!LED}} {{!DD}} {{!ToA}}

**OR**

{{!LED}} {{!ET}} {{!LED}} {{!DD}} {{!ToA}}

The first option is for when you have B floating, while the second and third do
not require B floating. Both generate infinite storm, and play around different
pieces of interaction.

## Collective Brutality - Use Cases

{{!CoBru}}

Collective Brutality is a possible main-deck hedge to cards like Thalia and/or
Gaddock Teeg, as well as an alternate win condition in case Tendrils of Agony
gets exiled with Surgical Extraction.

Due to the fact that Collective Brutality makes you gain 2 life, you can loop
Doomsday.

{{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!CoBru}} {{!DD}}

## Act on Impulse

Act on Impulse allows for more traditional piles when you only have 3 mana
post-DD, and can't cast Experimental Frenzy.

Using Conjurer's Bauble with Act on Impulse allows for some classic Doomsday
piles without Frenzy. Conjurer's Bauble allows you to get 6 storm with 5 cards
using this pile. You need 2RU, a cantrip, and 3 storm for this to work.

{{!AoI}} {{!ToA}} {{!LED}} {{!CB}} {{!PN}}

1. Cast cantrip, storm 4
2. Cast AoI, no mana floating, storm 5
3. Cast LED, storm 6
4. Crack LED for UUU, cast Conjurer's Bauble, storm 7
5. Crack bauble, putting LED on bottom
6. Cast Ponder and draw LED, storm 8
7. Cast LED, storm 9
8. Crack for BBB and cast ToA, storm 10

Sometimes you will not have access to the graveyard, and then you should use
this pile mentioned earlier:

{{!AoI}} {{!LED}} {{!LED}} {{!Pre}} {{!ToA}}

This pile creates 5 storm, which is usually enough.

According to data we have gathered so far, using the Act on Impulse pile occurs
around 25% of the time, and should definitely be utilized if possible.

I have covered most of the basic piles you will need to become proficient with
the deck, but of course, there are more small variations to play around
different spells and sideboard cards, and those will be in a future article.
