title: Stacks on stacks - The choices of interaction
---

With the tumultuous start to the year now easing up a little and Lurrus/the
Companion mechanic being pushed out, we are able (at least until the next
printing disaster) to take stock and ease into a semi stable metagame. For
Doomsday, this means being able to stack up some results and get some real
testing in. The core of Meandeck Doomsday is pretty well settled now however
there are some key variations that are being tested and debated on.

Recently, in the Discord, the discussion came up of the advantages and
disadvantages of different interaction elements. This includes choices which
inform colour selection for the main deck, sideboard and takes into account
playstyle and meta considerations.

In this article I will look to build upon what was discussed on the splash
colour selection in [in my last article](/articles/2020/03/22/ddfaq/) and go
into some of the nuances in using the different tools available to us when
playing. I will also provide some real world examples where certain elements
have shone and finish off with mention of the greatest matchup in Legacy.

## The Tools

Previously I discussed a variety of options that different colour splashes
provide. In this article I will provide a defined list of *categories* that will
be compared and discussed in further detail however this is far from an
exhuastive selection. It also does not take into account Force of Will which is
pretty much a "core tool" in the deck and unlikely to be

- Discard
- Veil of Summer
- Orim's Chant / Silence
- REB / Pyroblast
- Daze
- Spell Pierce / Flusterstorm

### Discard

Discard comprises of some ratio of {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Duress}} and
{{Cabal Therapy}}. Of the three the former is favoured thanks to the ability to
hit relevant hatebears like {{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}}, {{Meddling Mage}}
or {{Eidolon of the Great Revel}}, even despite the life loss clause. Duress
hits most relevant, stack based interaction and no life loss clause means it is
most suitable to be used post {{Doomsday}} resolution as in-pile protection.
Because of this balance 1-3 Thoughtseize and 1-2 Duress is probably advised. I
personally like 2:1 in Thoughtseize's favour.

Therapy is less favoured at the moment. It has a greater range of efficacy with
a *higher ceiling* of potentially getting multiple hate pieces out of hand in
one sweep but with a *lower floor* of failing to take anything at all. It does
have one other advantage (if running {{Baleful Strix}} in the deck) that allows
you to cast it multiple times thanks to the flashback clause. Nevilshute has
recently been having great success running a 1:1:1 ratio of all three discard
spells in their main deck for maximum flexibility.

Targeted discard is a very effective protection method as it allows both the
removal of at least one piece of opposing interaction from the opponent. Unlike
other options, discard can be used in any preceeding turns to protect the combo
or take out any disruptive permanents that may appear (like
{{Chalice of the Void}}). It also gives information about the opposing player's
hand to help inform future decisions.

The main downside to discard, and why it is not the most prevalent secondary
interaction element, after counter magic, is of course {{Veil of Summer}}.
Firing a discard spell into an open {{G}} mana is a recipe for giving your
opponent a 2 for 1. Despite this current meta trend, it's still worth running,
it just requires some additional consideration for timing of use.

### Veil of Summer

Veil is a very effective tool to combat countermagic or, as just mentioned,
protect from opposing discard. It can be an effective way of powering out
Doomsday, with a little extra card advantage on the side. Unlike discard, Veil
is not as effective to deal with opposing interaction on any turns prior to the
one where you intend to cast Doomsday. It also has some additonal considerations
on any intended Doomsday combo turn as well.

Veil's cantrip ability can be both a boon and a detriment depending on the
timing. You need to consider, if intending to *push* Doomsday through with Veil
you need to consider the implications of them letting the Doomsday resolve with
the Veil stil in hand and the potential to need to use it after it has resolved.
You may need to build the pile under the assumption of both Veil resolving (and
cantripping) or not resolving / resolving without cantripping. If not properly
considered, you may find yourself in a scenario where Veil is your only
protection and {{Thassa's Oracle}} is on the Stack facing a {{Force of Will}}
where you have no cards left in your library. Suddenly the perceived advantage
of Veil decreases dramatically.

Because of this, in the context of allowing Doomsday to resolve, it can often be
worth initiating the fight by casting Veil *without value*. It may still force
out a response from your opponent and, if paired with other interaction, could
still allow you value if the stack starts to get more complex, leading to Veil
resolving after other responses from your opponent (such as a desperation
{{Brainstorm}} for example).

Another thing to note is Veil can offer a false sense of security. It does not
protect from cards like {{Surgical Extraction}}, {{Mindbreak Trap}} or
{{Stifle}} and thus, should you be in a matchup where these cards are relevant,
you must still consider them.

### Orim's Chant / Silence

These function much in the same way as Veil does most of the time. They are much
worse at being used defensively against opposing discard and do not provide an
inherent *anti-card-disadvantage* clause in them. They are also very bad if you
do not intend to win in the same turn that you are resolving Doomsday in.
Despite this they are pretty potent tools in the right scenario. At worst they
simply *eat* a counterspell, just as a Duress or Veil might do so. At best they
prevent (hopefully) all the opposing interaction available. Other than corner
cases such as cycling {{Nimble Obstructionist}}, eating Oracle out of the
graveyard in response to {{Unearth}} with {{Faerie Macabre}} or an
{{Aether Vial}} on 4 putting a {{Venser, Shaper Savant}} into play to bounce
Oracle off the stack, it should protect you from 99& of what you can expect to
face.

If you were to consider a hypothetical combo mirror the three tools above would
hold somewhat of a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. Discard tends to be more effective
against {{W}} chant effects, chants better than Veil and Veil beats up on discard.
All three sets of tools are perfectly justifiable in use and there is a certain
amount of playstyle preference and local / wider metagame shift to consider.

### REB / Pyroblast

The next tool to discuss is the pairing of {{Red Elemental Blast}} and {{Pyroblast}}.
Often these simply perform like an additional (albeit more limited) copy of
Force of Will however there is a bit more nuance to using them in/ considering them for
your list. They cannot fight over opposing threats for the most part other than
something like {{Show and Tell}} or {{Echo of Eons}} but are instead good at defending
against opposing countermagic. They are not effective against opposing Red Blasts but
are effective at not being countered by said opposing Red Blasts. Equally, they don't
prevent Veil from resolving but equally do not feed into it obtaining *value*
 which can make the consideration of using the Veil trickier. Splitting your
 Red Blast effects is a good idea whenfacing cards like {{Surgical Extraction}}
 or {{Meddling Mage}} as it stops the opponent being able to completely *lock out*
 you from the Red Blast effects completely. This is anothe reason it's good to
 have a mix of Discard effects too, if running them.
 
 Red Blasts have the second function that makes them favourable which is the ability
 to potential remove threats from the board as well. {{Narset, Parter of Veils}}, 
 {{Leovold, Emmissary of Trest}} and {{Delver of Secrets}} are all viable targets
 that warrant removal assuming they were able to resolve in the first place. Though they
 can be countered (unlike common counterpart {{Abrupt Decay}}) they do not get stopped
 by Veil as decay can be.
 
 As with the other three previously mentioned, when to bring Red Blasts along can depend
 on playstyle, personal preference, expected metagame shifts, or even just limitations
 of your collection (as some may not have the correct dual lands for a given splash which
 is totally okay!). There is currently no objectively correct answer on which interaction
 to bring to the table however a mix is generally considered better. Normally the mix
 inolves pairing Discard plus one of the other colour splashes (the deck inherently being
 base {{UB}} meaning this is easier to support) however running say 6-8 Chant/Silences is
 not uncommon. Certain tools are of course better or worse depending on what you are facing 
 and tend to favour being good against facing against {{U}} based decks.
 
 ### Daze
 
 {{Daze}} gets a slot all by itself over other potential countermagic due to the mana 
 efficiency it displays. It enables easy and aggressive early combo turns and can protect
 against a variety of threats. In games expected to go longer it does lose its viability
 at hitting something but otherwise it can provide an efficient *soft counter*. This
 makes it especially viable to be placed inside a Doomsday pile. 
 
 Consider the following example:
 
 You have resolved Doomsday/drawn into your stack and have {{UUU}} available.
 
 <row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!Daze}} {{!TO}}</row>
 
 Where something like a Veil, Duress or Force would require additional cards in
 hand or additional mana, the Daze is easy to *slot* into our basic pile. 
 
 You can also perform some useful tricks with Daze alongside some of the other cards in
 order to re-use lands when you have a spare land drop or colour filter between them.
 
 ### Spell Pierce / Flusterstorm
 
 These are both proven and effective disruption / protection pieces. {{Spell Pierce}} has 
 the added benefit of being able to deal with a Chalice or Narset in addition to other
 stack based interaction whereas {{Flusterstorm}} is just generally more efficient, 
 normally able to win a large counterwar by itself (generally only superceeded by an 
 opposing Veil or sometimes another Fluster. Both are of course *soft* counters and 
 thus, like Daze, can lose effectiveness in a longer game. These are perfectly fine
 to be used in a pile, especially with an excess of {{U}} available however, unlike
 the other, more proactive pieces, these can't be used effectively alongside
 {{Lion's Eye Diamond}}. 
 
 ## Example Scenarios
 
 With that, you have a pretty concise (however certainly non-exhaustive) list of stack
 based interaction tools that could be run. We will now look at a few scenarios where
 you could find yourself wanting one or more of them including some real world game
 examples.
 
### Scenario 1: 

> Game 1. 
> You're at 13 life. 
> Opponent is on RUG Delver ft. {{Stifle}}. 
> Opponent has 2 {{Tarmogyf}} in play. Both are 3/4.  
> {{Snow-Covered Swamp}}, {{Snow-Covered Island}}, {{Snow-Covered Island}}, {{Bayou}} and {{Arcum's Astrolabe}} in play.  
> You already played a land.  
> Opponent has a single uncracked fetchland in play. 4 cards in hand.  

<row variant="hand">{{!DR|MM}} {{!DD|WTH}} {{!FoW|EMA}} {{!Daze|NEM}} {{!BS|MM}} {{!Dur|PD3}}</row>

In this example we have a situation where if we want to win, we have to be able to resolve
Doomsday and win in the same turn thanks to the two Goyfs facing us. Let's quickly explore
the face value options and compare them to what the opponent could have, and the other tools
at our disposal. 

As the scenario stands, the first thing to try would be to consider whether to use the Duress
or not. If we think they do not have any interaction, or only a single piece of basic interaction,
we could consider casting {{Dark Ritual}} into Doomsday and build something simple like:

 <row variant="pile">{{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!EoA}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

This will allow us to win through a single piece of disruption thanks to the Force of Will
where we would pitch Daze to Force and Brainstorm into the pile. It does however fold
to if they have two pieces of interaction. We are constrained on being able to rely
on both Daze and Force as it may be that they only have *pitch* countermagic and so can
hold up the fetchland to pay for the Daze. It would also mean we would need to *pitch*
Brainstorm to the Force leaving us with no way to draw into our pile. As a result
it is probably best to Duress first to see if we are able to commit into a pile
with Force and / or Daze backup.

If we had Veil instead of Duress we should probably also cast it here first. If they
cannot stop it then there is only Stifle that we need to be concerned with. You would 
also have to consider not being able to build a pile that wins with >0 cards in the
library as they may still have {{Lightning Bolt}} for Oracle. Waiting on
Veil to try and accrue value is fine if you know they have an answer to Doomsday here
however awkward if they elect to not use it until after the pile is resolved. We cannot
assume whether we will be able to resolve Veil and make effective use of the card draw.
If we were to have Silence, then they would have to stop it or lose any chance to interact.

For any of the above, if they do try and counter it, we would need to consider whether to
commit more cards or not. If they use a Force of Will you cannot Daze back here however
it leaves them with only 2 cards left in hand and you with access to Force and/or Daze.
If they use a Daze then it gets a little trickier. If it's Duress you can probably pay
and maybe wait until next turn to try and go off, now with them 2 cards down and you with
additional mana available. If it's Silence or Veil you likely are unable to win this turn
and so it is probably better to not pay for it. If it's a Spell Pierce they commit, we
can probably commit our Daze to stop it as they have now left themselves unable to pay
for it. 

> If we play Silence and it resolves without needing to commit further resource. (Using Snow-Covered Island through Astrolabe).

We can easily build a same turn win Brainstorm + LED pile and win.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!EoA}} {{!IU}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

   1. Silence has resolved.
   1. Cast Dark Ritual with Snow-Covered Swamp into Doomsday building the above pile.
   1. Cast Brainstorm with Snow-Covered Island, putting back Force and Ideas Unbound on top.
   1. Cast Lion's Eye Diamond
   1. Cycle EoA cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw Ideas Unbound
   1. Cast Ideas Unbound and draw Force, LP, Oracle
   1. Use the {U} floating and LP to cast Oracle
   
> If we play Veil and it resolves without needing to commit further resource. (Using Bayou).

We need to try and build something that plays around Stifle or removal for Oracle
however we could consider not trying to play around either. They cannot commit both
due to their mana constraints so Daze should be sufficient to protect us.

<row variant="pile">{{!LED}} {{!IU}} {{!Pn}} {{!LP}} {{!TO}}</row>

   1. Veil has resolved.
   1. Cast Dark Ritual with Snow-Covered Swamp into Doomsday building the above pile.
   1. Cast Brainstorm with Snow-Covered Island, putting back Daze and Ideas Unbound on top.
   1. Cast Lion's Eye Diamond
   1. Cast Ponder with Snow -Covered Island cracking LED for {U}{U}{U} and draw Ideas Unbound
   1. Cast Ideas Unbound and draw Daze, LP, Oracle
   1. Use the {U} floating and LP to cast Oracle
   1. Cast Daze on any interaction they might have.
   
   > If we play Duress and it resolves we see the following hand:
   
  <row variant="hand">{{!Spell Snare}} {{!Stifle}} {{!Scalding Tarn}} {{!Daze|NEM}} {{!Oko, Thief of Crowns}}</row> 

Whereas Veil and Silence (in this instance) have effectively nullified a chunk of their hand, 
Duress, although giving us information on it, has unfortunately still left a problem. We cannot
mimic what we did with a resolved Veil as, depending on what we take, they could still Daze /
{{Spell Snare}} the pile. Now that weve seen their hand, we need to assess what we can / should
take and whether we can "go for it" this turn. We know they don't have removal so it opens up the
options for a pile that doesn't leave the deck with 0 cards left in it. We also know they can
only use on of their 1 cmc spells if Daze were to be taken which, we could then deal with our
own Daze. If we take the Snare it would allow us access to Ideas Unbound however we wouldn't be
able to draw into it with Ponder (thanks to Daze) and we couldn't cycle into it with Edge
(thanks to Stifle).
