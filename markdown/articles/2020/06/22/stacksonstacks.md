title: Stacks on stacks - The choices of interaction.
---

With the tumultuous start to the year now easing up a little and
Lurrus/the Companion mechanic being pushed out, we are able (at
least until the next printing disaster) to take stock and ease
into a semi stable metagame. For Doomsday, this means being able
to stack up some results and get some real testing in. The core
of Meandeck Doomsday is pretty well settled now however there are
some key variations that are being tried and debated on.

Recently, on the Discord, the discussion came up of the advantages
and disadvantages of different interaction elements. This includes
choices which inform colour selection for the main deck, sideboard
and takes into account playstyle and meta considerations. 

In this article I will look to build upon what was discussed on 
the splash colour selection in [in my last article](/articles/2020/03/22/ddfaqs/) 
and go into some of the nuances in using the different tools 
available to us when playing. I will also provide some real world 
examples where certain elements have shone and finish off with 
mention of the greatest matchup in Legacy.

## 1. The Tools

Previously I discussed a variety of options that different colour
splashes provide. In this article I will provide a defined list
of 'categories' that will be compared and discussed in further
detail however this is far from an exhuastive selection. It 
also does not take into account Force of Will which is pretty 
much a "core tool" in the deck and unlikely to be 

   - Discard
   - Veil of Summer
   - Orim's Chant/Silence
   - Pyroblast
   - Daze


### Discard

Discard comprises of some ratio of {{Thoughtseize}}, {{Duress}} and
{{Cabal Therapy}}. Of the three the former is favoured thanks to the
ability to hit relevant hatebears like {{Thalia, Guardian of Thraben}},
{{Meddling Mage}} or {{Eidolon of the Great Revel}}, even despite the 
life loss clause. Duress hits most relevant, stack based interaction
and no life loss clause means it is most suitable to be used post
{{Doomsday}} resolution as in-pile protection. Because of this balance
1-3 Thoughtseize and 1-2 Duress is probably advised. I personally like
2:1 in Thoughtseize's favour. 

Therapy is less favoured at the moment. It has a greater range of efficacy
with a 'higher ceiling' of potentially getting multiple hate pieces out of
hand in one sweep but with a 'lower floor' of failing to take anything at
all. It does have on other advantage (if running {{Baleful Strix}} in the
deck) that allows you to cast it multiple times thanks to the flashback
clause. Nevilshute has recently been having great success running a 
1:1:1 ratio of all three discard spells in his main deck for maximum 
flexibility.

Targeted discard is a very effective protection method as it allows both
the removal of at least one piece of opposing interaction from the 
opponent. Unlike other options, discard can be used in any preceeding
turns to protect the combo or take out any disruptive permanents that
may appear (like {{Chalice of the Void}}). It also gives information
about the opposing player's hand to help inform future decisions. 

The main downside to discard, and why it is not the most prevalent
secondary interaction element, after counter magic, is of course {{Veil
of Summer}}. Firing a discard spell into an open {{G}} mana is a recipe
for giving your opponent a 2 for 1. Despite this current meta trend, 
it's still worth running, it just requires some additional consideration
for timing of use.


### Veil of Summer

Veil is a very effective tool to combat countermagic or, as just mentioned,
protect from opposing discard. It can be an effective way of powering out
Doomsday, with a little extra card advantage on the side. Unlike discard,
Veil is not as effective to deal with opposing interaction on any turns 
prior to the one where you intend to cast Doomsday. It also has some additonal
considerations on any intended Doomsday combo turn as well. 

Veil's cantrip ability can be both a boon and a detriment depending on the timing.
You need to consider, if intending to 'push' Doomsday through with Veil you need
to consider the implications of them letting the Doomsday resolve with the Veil
stil in hand and the potential to need to use it after it has resolved. You may
need to build the pile under the assumption of both Veil resolving (and 
cantripping) or not resolving / resolving without cantripping. If not properly
considered, you may find yourself in a scenario where Veil is your only protection
and {{Thassa's Oracle}} is on the Stack facing a {{Force of Will}} where you have
no cards left in your library. Suddenly the perceived advantage of Veil decreases
dramatically.

Because of this, in the context of allowing Doomsday to resolve, it can often be worth
initiating the fight by casting Veil 'without value'. It may still force out a response
from your opponent and, if paired with other interaction, could still allow you value
if the stack starts to get more complex, leading to Veil resolving after other
responses from your opponent (such as a desperation {{Brainstorm}} for example).

Another thing to note is Veil can offer a false sense of security. It does not protect
from cards like {{Surgical Extraction}}, {{Mindbreak Trap}} or {{Stifle}} and thus, 
should you be in a matchup where these cards are relevant, you must still consider them.


### Orim's Chant / Silence

These function much in the same way as Veil does most of the time. They are much worse
at being used defensively against opposing discard and do not provide an inherent
'anti-card-disadvantage' clause in them. They are also very bad if you do not intend
to win in the same turn that you are resolving Doomsday in. Despite this they are
pretty potent tools in the right scenario. At worst they simply 'eat' a counterspell, 
just as a Duress or Veil might do so. At best they prevent (hopefully) all the opposing
interaction available. Other than corner cases such as cycling {{Nimble Obstructionist}},
eating Oracle out of the graveyard in response to {{Unearth}} with {{Faerie Macabre}} or
an {{Aether Vial}} on 4 putting a {{Venser, Shaper Savant}} into play to bounce Oracle
off the stack, it should protect you from 99& of what you can expect to face.
