With the influx of new interest towards the archetype, there
has been a rise in new players gravitating towards our favourite
{{BBB}} sorcery. With this surge in new blood there have been a
number of questions that keep cropping up for people either 
interested, or starting off playing {{Doomsday}}. I had hoped to
at least start answering many of the questions
[in my first article](/article/2020/03/12/pretty-mean-deck.md) 
, which you should really have a read of before going through this
one, however it seems I didn't touch on many points so hopefully this
should provide some clarity on the following things:

## 1. The Different Doomsday Archetypes

Although it wasn't always the case, it seems currently the most 
popular medium for discussing specific Legacy archetypes (at the 
time of writing) is via dedicated Discord servers for each
archetype. The Doomsday community is no exception to this and
though it may seem like a very aggressive and somewhat shameless
plug so early on in this article, there is a purpose to this.

Until recently we had one primary discussion channel for Legacy
Doomsday with no real regard for the different variants however with
so many people joining the server for one specific variant or another, 
we had to do a little tidy up. Part of this process included listing 
the variants out so that people could read a summary of each and select
the one/(s) they liked the sound of to have access to those select
parts of the server. Despite these summaries being present we still get
some confusion as to what the differences actually entail both in terms
of deck building decisions and in terms of personal preferences or
gameplay styles.

I will present the three main archetypes below with the current Discord 
summary and a more in depth discussion on each. 



### 1.1 DDFT (DoomsDay Fetchland Tendrils)

### 1.2 DDEFT (Doomsday Experimental Frenzy Tendrils)

### 1.3 Meandeck Doomsday (We couldn't decide on a good acronym for this one)
