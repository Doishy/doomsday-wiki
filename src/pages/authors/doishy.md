## Doishy

A UB obsessed Doomsday player from Bristol, UK. I enjoy paying my life into
oblivion, having opponents have to judge call to understand my cards and
collecting Gitaxian Probes. I have no notable success to my name but I am very
good at reviewing the play of others and coming up with ubiquitous BS in terms
of deckbuilding. My main goals are just trying to get better with my current aim
being to day 2 a GP.

I'm a cat person.
