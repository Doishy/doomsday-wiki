oppBoard: "Leyline of the Void, Thoughtknot Seer, Walking Ballista (1 Counter)"

yourBoard: >
  Tropical Island (Tapped), Underground Sea Lion's Eye Diamond, Thassa's Oracle
situationNotes: >
  In game 3, you find yourself at 9 life facing down some lethal beaters.
  Between the Leyline, Pitching Spells to Force of Will and the Thoughtknot Seer
  you have lost both copies of Predict and your second Oracle to exile. Despite
  this you find a line and take it home to win the match. Win this turn.
solution: "[Chain of Vapor, Street Wraith, X, X, X]"
solutionNotes: >
 The key thing to remember here actually lies within one of the opponent's
 cards. Thoughtknot Seer, when it leaves the battlefield, causes opponents to
 draw a card. You can use this to your advantage alongside Chain of Vapors copy
 clause to both pick up your own Oracle and re-play it as well as netting
 another draw into the stack. You also have to be wary of the Walking Ballista
 as too much life loss through Stree Wraith cycles can leave you dead to it.

 Cast Dark Ritual into Doomsday and stack [Chain of Vapor, Street Wraith,
 Ponder, X, X]. Cycle Edge of Autumn (Sacrificing the Tapped Tropical Island),
 hold priority to crack LED for UUU, to draw Chain of Vapor. Cast Chain
 targeting your own Oracle, copy it, sacrificing your second land to bounce the
 opposing Thoughtknot Seer. Seer with trigger causing you to draw Street Wraith.
 Cycle Street Wraith (going from 4 life post Doomsday to 2 life post Cycle) to
 draw X. Cast Oracle and win with two cards left in the library.
